RealityConnect-Hackathon
========================

Our project for the Koding #hackathon


## Description

We choose to create a chat as a service for platforms. The idea is for platforms where two diferent user (sellers and buyers) to better comunicate and negotiate through a chat application.

It is composed of:

- a website http://ujkk8b52147e.jonnybgod.koding.io/
	- landing page
	- account creation
	- website/app management

- a widget http://ujkk8b52147e.jonnybgod.koding.io/widget
	- demo: http://ujkk8b52147e.jonnybgod.koding.io/demo.html
	- to be embed on platforms' pages
	- provides a chat app for "buyers" to initiate a conversation with "sellers"

- a chat app http://ujkk8b52147e.jonnybgod.koding.io/chat
	- provides a centralized point for users to comunicate and manage their contacts

The idea came from the fact that these kind of platforms usualy only provide email through a form for users to comunicate. This is slow, not as personal as a chat and leads to more confusion in conversations.

We want to try to make it better for the end users.
